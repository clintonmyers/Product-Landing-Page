  This site was created using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 4 with a mobile first approach for modern sized smartphones. It was subsequently scaled up for a large desktop view using a mixture of media queries and responsive design elements. Several open licensed background images were acquired from pexels.com, and free social media icons were found at fontawesome.com.
